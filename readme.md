Introduction

Encode Hack provides a framework for processing cryptocurrency sentiment data and offers an example of how to combine various components (data services, configuration handling, logging) into a cohesive application. Whether you’re looking to expand on this project or use it as a starting point for more in-depth data analysis, the design is aimed to be both flexible and straightforward.
Features

    Data Analysis:
    Parse and analyze sentiment data from a JSON file (e.g., crypto_sentiments.json).

    Modular Components:
    Separate modules for application logic (app.py), configuration (config.py), logging (logging_config.py), and data handling (found under the data_services directory) make it easy to extend or maintain.

    Python Environment:
    Built entirely using Python, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and ease of integration with other Python-based data science or web tools.

Installation

Before running Encode Hack, ensure you have Python 3 installed.

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/jdm010/encode-hack.git
    cd encode-hack

Install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can launch the application by running:

    python app.py

The application may rely on the configurations set in the config.py file. Ensure that any necessary API keys, environment variables, or file paths are correctly specified there.
Configuration

    config.py:
    Contains the configuration settings for the application. Customize this file to adjust parameters such as file paths, API endpoints, and other settings specific to your deployment environment.

    logging_config.py:
    Defines the logging settings to help with debugging and monitoring. Adjust log levels and formats as needed.
